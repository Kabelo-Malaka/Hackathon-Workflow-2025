# Employee Lifecycle Management System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Transform manual paper-based employee onboarding/offboarding into automated, tracked workflows
- Eliminate security risks from orphaned accounts and uncollected equipment during offboarding
- Provide real-time visibility into onboarding/offboarding progress for all stakeholders
- Enforce mandatory verification checklists to prevent missed provisioning/deprovisioning tasks
- Reduce average onboarding completion time by 40% (from 5 days to 3 days)
- Achieve 100% offboarding completion rate with zero orphaned accounts after 30 days
- Integrate seamlessly with existing Outlook email workflows to minimize adoption friction
- Enable automated offboarding mirror that uses onboarding records to generate deprovisioning checklists

### Background Context

The Employee Lifecycle Management System addresses critical gaps in Magna BC's current "Appointment of Staff Procedure" (`control-documents/onboarding.md`), a manual paper-based checklist requiring coordination between HR Manager, Line Manager, Tech Support, and Administrators to provision 30+ hardware, software, and access items across 10 sections (A-J). The current process suffers from lack of centralized tracking (no visibility into progress or bottlenecks), consistency problems (varying setups for similar roles), verification gaps (manual checkboxes without enforcement), and significant security risks during offboarding (orphaned accounts in systems like MS 365, GitHub, SharePoint, Teams, Jira, and uncollected equipment).

This web-based workflow orchestration platform will serve as a single source of truth, automatically routing tasks to appropriate stakeholders, enforcing verification checkpoints at each stage, and maintaining a complete audit trail. The intelligent offboarding mirror feature ensures perfect symmetry—everything provisioned during onboarding is tracked and deprovisioned during offboarding, eliminating security gaps from forgotten accounts. By integrating with Outlook email, the system fits within existing communication workflows while providing the structure, accountability, and visibility that email alone cannot deliver.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The system should feel like a **mission control center** for employee transitions—providing at-a-glance status visibility while keeping detailed checklists accessible when needed. The interface should balance two key user needs: (1) HR and managers need executive-level dashboard views to spot bottlenecks, and (2) task executors (tech support, line managers) need focused, checklist-driven interfaces that guide them through verification without distraction.

**Design Principles:**
- **Clarity over aesthetics** - Status must be instantly recognizable through color coding and visual hierarchy
- **Progressive disclosure** - Show overview first, details on demand
- **Task-focused workflows** - When a user clicks an email link, land them directly on the relevant task form with minimal navigation
- **Forgiving interactions** - Allow saving partial progress; don't force completion in one session
- **Responsive but desktop-first** - Optimize for desktop workflows (HR and tech support work at desks) with tablet support for managers on the move

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Kanban-style workflow visualization** - Dashboard shows employee cards moving through pipeline stages (Initiated → In Progress → Blocked → Complete)
- **Email-driven task initiation** - Primary interaction starts from Outlook: "You have a new task" → Click link → Redirect to web form → Complete form → Confirm
- **Checklist-driven completion** - Task forms present all items requiring verification with mandatory checkboxes; submit button remains disabled until all checked
- **Contextual notifications** - System surfaces relevant information at the right time (e.g., when marking a task complete, show dependencies that will be unblocked)
- **Unified dashboard with smart filtering** - Single dashboard view adapts based on user role through intelligent filters: HR sees all employees, line managers filter to their team, tech support filters to assigned tasks

### Core Screens and Views

From a product perspective, these are the critical screens necessary to deliver the PRD goals:

- **Dashboard (All Roles)** - Main landing page showing employee workflow pipeline with smart filters by status, department, role, and assigned user; adapts to show relevant data based on user's role
- **Employee Detail View** - Drill-down showing complete workflow for a single employee with task breakdown, timeline, and responsible parties
- **Task Completion Form** - Focused interface for completing assigned tasks with dynamic checklists, conditional fields, and verification requirements
- **Template Builder (Admin/HR Only)** - Form-based workflow designer for creating/editing onboarding and offboarding templates with configuration fields for tasks, dependencies, and role assignments
- **Template Library (Admin/HR Only)** - Browse and manage workflow templates with versioning and role mappings
- **Task Queue (Tech Support/Manager)** - Personal worklist showing all assigned tasks sorted by priority and due date
- **Audit Trail View (Admin/HR Only)** - Historical log of all actions taken on employee workflows with filtering and export capabilities
- **Email Preview (Admin/HR Only)** - Preview and customize email notification templates sent to stakeholders

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The system will target **WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance** to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities. This includes:
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Sufficient color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Screen reader compatibility with semantic HTML and ARIA labels
- Form labels and error messages clearly associated with inputs
- No reliance on color alone to convey information (use icons + text)

### Branding

Minimal custom branding for MVP; focus on clean, professional enterprise UI using Material-UI (MUI) defaults with minor customization:
- Use Magna BC logo in header/navigation
- Apply company primary color to key UI elements (buttons, headers, active states)
- Maintain consistent typography and spacing per MUI guidelines
- Avoid heavy theming that could delay MVP delivery

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

**Primary Target:** Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari latest 2 versions) at 1920x1080 and 1366x768 resolutions

**Secondary Target:** Tablets (iPad, Android tablets) in landscape orientation for manager dashboard views

**Not Supported in MVP:** Mobile phones (too small for complex checklist interactions), IE11 or legacy browsers

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

**Decision:** Single Git repository containing both frontend and backend code in separate directories

**Structure:**
```
/
├── frontend/          (React + TypeScript)
├── backend/           (Spring Boot + Java)
├── docker-compose.yml (Orchestration)
└── README.md
```

**Rationale:** Monorepo simplifies coordination between frontend and backend teams during MVP development, enables atomic commits across API contracts, and aligns with the Project Brief's stated preference. With only two primary services, the monorepo overhead is minimal while providing significant developer experience benefits.

### Service Architecture

**Architecture Style:** Modular Monolith with clear service boundaries

**Core Services/Modules:**
- **WorkflowService** - Manages workflow templates, instances, and state transitions
- **NotificationService** - Handles email generation and SMTP delivery
- **TemplateService** - CRUD operations for workflow templates and custom fields
- **UserService** - Authentication, authorization, and user management
- **AuditService** - Logging and audit trail for all system actions

**Rationale:** The Project Brief specifies "Modular monolith with clear service boundaries." This approach provides service separation for maintainability while avoiding the operational complexity of microservices for MVP. As volume is projected at <50 transitions/month initially, a monolith can easily handle the load while keeping deployment simple. Services can be extracted to microservices post-MVP if scaling demands it.

**Database:** Single PostgreSQL database shared across all services; use schema/namespace separation for logical boundaries if needed.

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy:** Unit + Integration Testing (Full Testing Pyramid not required for MVP)

**Coverage Requirements:**
- **Unit Tests:** Core business logic in services (target 80% coverage for service layer)
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoint testing with test database (happy path + critical error scenarios)
- **Manual Testing:** UI workflows and email integration (no automated E2E tests in MVP)

**Testing Tools:**
- Backend: JUnit 5, Mockito for mocking, TestContainers for integration tests with PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Jest for unit tests, React Testing Library for component tests
- API Testing: Postman collections for manual API validation

**Rationale:** The Brief states "1 part-time QA engineer" resource constraint. Full E2E automation requires significant investment better deferred to Phase 2. Focus on strong unit/integration coverage where ROI is highest, supplement with structured manual test plans for UI and email workflows. TestContainers provides excellent integration test isolation without complex test infrastructure.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Technology Stack:**
- **Framework:** React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- **State Management:** React Redux with Redux Toolkit for global state
- **API Client:** RTK Query for data fetching and caching; OpenAPI codegen to generate TypeScript client from backend Swagger spec
- **UI Component Library:** Material-UI (MUI) v5 for consistent enterprise components
- **Build Tool:** Vite for fast development builds and hot module replacement
- **Form Management:** React Hook Form for complex form validation (especially template builder and task completion forms)

**Backend Technology Stack:**
- **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.x (Java 17+)
- **Database Migration:** Liquibase for versioned schema management
- **Data Layer:** Spring Data JPA with Hibernate ORM; use DTOs at controller boundaries (not exposing entities directly)
- **Code Reduction:** Lombok for reducing boilerplate (getters, setters, constructors)
- **API Documentation:** SpringDoc OpenAPI (Swagger) for automatic API spec generation
- **Email:** Spring Mail with JavaMail for SMTP integration
- **Validation:** Jakarta Bean Validation for request validation
- **Security:** Spring Security for authentication/authorization with session-based auth; **session timeout: 15 minutes of inactivity**
- **Password Storage:** BCrypt hashing (Spring Security default)

**Database:**
- **PostgreSQL 17** (latest stable version as of 2025) for relational data integrity
- Use Liquibase changesets for all schema changes (no manual DDL)
- Enable audit columns (created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at) on all tables

**Infrastructure & Deployment:**
- **Containerization:** Docker for both frontend (nginx serving static build) and backend (Spring Boot JAR)
- **Orchestration:** Docker Compose for local development and production deployment
- **Infrastructure Assumptions:**
  - Docker host with 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM minimum
  - Frontend container: nginx:alpine (minimal footprint ~50MB)
  - Backend container: openjdk:17-slim with Spring Boot app (~200MB)
  - PostgreSQL container: postgres:17-alpine (~250MB)
  - Total resource allocation: Backend 2GB RAM, Database 4GB RAM, Frontend 512MB RAM
  - Persistent volumes for database data and application logs
- **Environment Configuration:** Environment variables for configuration (database credentials, SMTP settings); no hardcoded secrets
- **Logging:** Structured JSON logging to stdout (capture in Docker logs); use SLF4J + Logback on backend
- **Deployment Process:**
  - Build frontend React app to static files
  - Build backend Spring Boot JAR
  - Create Docker images for both
  - Use docker-compose up to start all services (frontend, backend, database)
  - Run Liquibase migrations on startup
  - Health check endpoints on backend for monitoring

**Development Environment:**
- **Version Control:** Git with feature branch workflow
- **Code Quality:** ESLint + Prettier for frontend; Checkstyle for backend (optional for MVP but recommended)
- **IDE Support:** VSCode for frontend, IntelliJ IDEA for backend
- **Deployment Strategy:** Local Docker deployment only for MVP; no CI/CD pipeline required. Developers run `docker-compose up` locally for development and testing.

**Security & Compliance:**
- Use HTTPS in production (TLS certificates via Let's Encrypt or corporate CA)
- Implement CORS policy allowing only frontend origin
- Use parameterized queries everywhere (JPA handles this by default)
- Hash passwords with BCrypt (Spring Security default)
- Implement CSRF protection for session-based auth
- Set appropriate HTTP security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- **SSO Integration:** Not required for MVP; implement basic username/password authentication with future SSO integration path

**Email Integration:**
- **SMTP Server:** smtp.gmail.com
- **Port:** 587 (TLS/STARTTLS)
- **Email Account:** ctrlalteliteg@gmail.com
- **Authentication:** Application-specific password (not regular Gmail password) for security
- **Configuration:** Store credentials in environment variables (SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USERNAME, SMTP_PASSWORD)
- Use HTML email templates with embedded CSS for consistent rendering across email clients
- Include text-only fallback for email clients that don't support HTML
- Log all email send attempts (timestamp, recipient, subject, status) for debugging and audit
- Implement retry logic for transient SMTP failures (max 3 retries with exponential backoff)
- Handle Gmail rate limits (500 emails/day for free accounts; consider G Suite if higher volume needed)

**Performance Considerations:**
- Database connection pooling (HikariCP default in Spring Boot, configure pool size 10-20)
- Implement pagination for employee lists (max 50 per page)
- Use database indexes on frequently queried columns (employee_id, status, assigned_user_id, due_date)
- Frontend: Lazy load routes with React.lazy() to reduce initial bundle size
- Cache email templates in memory (no need to rebuild HTML on every send)

**Assumptions:**
- Developers have experience with chosen tech stack (React, Spring Boot)
- Gmail SMTP access is reliable and rate limits are acceptable for MVP volume
- Docker runtime (Docker Engine 20.10+ or Docker Desktop) is available on development machines and production servers
- No legacy system integration required for MVP (manual data entry acceptable)
- Application-specific password for Gmail account will be provided by operations team
- 15-minute session timeout is acceptable trade-off between security and user convenience

4. PostgreSQL 17 service is configured with persistent volume for data storage
5. Environment variables are externalized (database credentials, SMTP config) via .env file (with .env.example template)
6. Services have appropriate resource limits (backend 2GB, postgres 4GB, frontend 512MB)
7. Health check endpoints are configured for backend service
8. All services start successfully with `docker-compose up` and can communicate with each other
9. Database initialization scripts run on first startup

### Story 1.3: Database Schema Foundation & Liquibase Setup

As a **developer**,
I want the PostgreSQL database schema initialized with core tables and Liquibase migration framework configured,
so that all database changes are versioned and the schema includes audit columns for tracking data modifications.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Liquibase is integrated into Spring Boot backend with configuration in application.yml
2. Initial changelog file (db.changelog-master.yaml) is created in src/main/resources/db/changelog
3. Users table is created with columns: id (UUID), username, email, password_hash, role, created_at, created_by, updated_at, updated_by, is_active
4. Roles enumeration supports: HR_ADMIN, LINE_MANAGER, TECH_SUPPORT, ADMINISTRATOR
5. All tables include audit columns (created_at, created_by, updated_at, updated_by) as standard
6. Database indexes are created on frequently queried columns (users.email, users.username)
7. Liquibase migrations run automatically on application startup
8. Migration history is tracked in DATABASECHANGELOG table
9. Rollback scripts are defined for all migrations

### Story 1.4: Authentication & Session Management

As a **user (any role)**,
I want to log in with username and password and have my session maintained for 15 minutes of inactivity,
so that I can securely access the system and my session automatically expires when I'm inactive.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Spring Security is configured with session-based authentication (not JWT)
2. Login endpoint (POST /api/auth/login) accepts username and password, returns success/failure
3. Passwords are hashed using BCrypt before storage
4. Successful login creates HTTP session with 15-minute inactivity timeout
5. Session cookies are configured with HttpOnly and Secure flags (in production)
6. Logout endpoint (POST /api/auth/logout) invalidates the session
7. Unauthorized requests (401) redirect to login page or return appropriate error
8. CSRF protection is enabled for all non-GET requests
9. Login attempts are logged (username, timestamp, success/failure) for audit purposes
10. Failed login attempts return generic error message (don't reveal if username exists)

### Story 1.4b: Global Error Handling Middleware

As a **developer**,
I want centralized error handling middleware configured for consistent API error responses,
so that all endpoints return structured error formats and validation/authorization errors are handled uniformly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. GlobalExceptionHandler class is created with @ControllerAdvice annotation
2. Handler catches and transforms common exceptions into structured error responses with format:
   - timestamp (ISO 8601), status (HTTP code), error (error type), message (human-readable), path (endpoint)
3. Validation errors (400 Bad Request) include optional details array with field-specific error messages
4. Handler processes these exception types:
   - MethodArgumentNotValidException → 400 Bad Request with validation details
   - ResourceNotFoundException (custom) → 404 Not Found
   - ConflictException (custom) → 409 Conflict
   - AccessDeniedException → 403 Forbidden
   - Exception (catch-all) → 500 Internal Server Error
5. Custom exceptions created: ResourceNotFoundException, ValidationException, ConflictException in exception/ package
6. Error responses do not expose sensitive information (stack traces, internal paths) in production
7. All error responses follow consistent JSON structure
8. CORS configuration is set to allow requests from frontend origin only
9. Unit tests verify error response format for each exception type
10. Swagger documentation shows example error responses for API endpoints

### Story 1.5: User Management CRUD

As an **HR Administrator**,
I want to create, view, update, and deactivate user accounts with role assignments,
so that I can manage access for all system users (HR, managers, tech support, administrators).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. API endpoints exist for user CRUD: POST /api/users, GET /api/users, GET /api/users/{id}, PUT /api/users/{id}, DELETE /api/users/{id} (soft delete)
2. Only HR_ADMIN role can access user management endpoints (403 Forbidden for others)
3. User creation requires: username, email, initial password, role
4. Email validation ensures proper email format
5. Username must be unique (enforced at database and API level)
6. Update operation allows changing email, role, and active status (not password via this endpoint)
7. Delete operation sets is_active=false (soft delete) rather than removing record
8. Password change endpoint (POST /api/users/{id}/change-password) is separate and requires current password verification
9. All CRUD operations update audit columns (created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at)
10. API returns appropriate DTOs (not exposing password_hash)

### Story 1.6: Frontend Authentication UI & Routing

As a **user (any role)**,
I want a login page and protected routing in the frontend,
so that I can authenticate and access role-appropriate pages while being redirected to login if not authenticated.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Login page is created with form fields for username and password
2. Login form submits credentials to backend /api/auth/login endpoint
3. Successful login stores authentication state in Redux and redirects to dashboard
4. Failed login displays error message to user
5. React Router is configured with protected routes that require authentication
6. Unauthenticated users attempting to access protected routes are redirected to login page
7. Logout button exists in navigation header and calls /api/auth/logout endpoint
8. Frontend includes basic navigation structure (header with app name and logout button)
9. Authentication state persists across page refreshes (check session with backend on app load)
10. Material-UI components are used for login form and layout

### Story 1.7: Basic User Management UI (HR Admin)

As an **HR Administrator**,
I want a user management page where I can view all users and create new user accounts,
so that I can onboard new system users before they can access the application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. User management page is accessible only to HR_ADMIN role (route guard enforced)
2. Page displays table of all users showing: username, email, role, active status
3. "Create User" button opens modal dialog with form fields: username, email, password, role dropdown
4. Form validation ensures all required fields are filled and email format is valid
5. Successful user creation closes modal, refreshes user list, and displays success notification
6. Failed user creation displays error message in modal
7. User list supports basic search/filter by username or email
8. Active/Inactive status is visually indicated (badge or icon)
9. Edit and deactivate actions are visible in table rows but need not be functional yet (can be completed in later story or iteration)
10. Material-UI components (Table, Modal, Form) are used for consistent styling

### Story 1.8: Testing Framework Setup

As a **developer**,
I want testing frameworks configured for both frontend and backend with sample tests,
so that I can write unit and integration tests from the start and maintain high code quality throughout development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

5. Task sequence_order is automatically renumbered if gaps exist (normalize to 1, 2, 3...)
6. Circular task dependencies are detected and rejected with clear error message
7. Custom field names must be unique within a template
8. Service methods return validation errors as structured error responses (not generic exceptions)
9. Service layer uses transaction management (all template changes commit or rollback atomically)
10. Unit tests cover validation logic and edge cases

### Story 2.4: Template Library UI

As an **HR Administrator**,
I want a template library page showing all workflow templates,
so that I can browse existing templates and select one to create, edit, or activate.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Template library page displays cards or table rows for each template

2. "Add Task" button adds new task entry to form with fields: task name (required), description, assigned role (dropdown: HR_ADMIN/LINE_MANAGER/TECH_SUPPORT/ADMINISTRATOR)
3. Tasks are displayed in a list with sequence order automatically assigned based on position
4. Each task has "Move Up," "Move Down," and "Remove" buttons to reorder or delete
5. Tasks can be marked as "Run in Parallel" with checkbox (parallel tasks get same sequence_order)
6. Task dependency dropdown allows selecting a previous task as prerequisite (only tasks with lower sequence_order are options)
7. Form validates that template name is required and tasks list is not empty
8. "Save Template" button submits complete template structure to backend POST /api/templates
9. Successful save displays success notification and redirects to template library
10. Failed save displays validation errors inline on form fields
11. "Cancel" button confirms unsaved changes and navigates back to template library

### Story 2.6: Template Builder Form - Custom Fields

8. Preview section shows how custom fields will appear in workflow execution form
9. Custom fields are saved as part of template when "Save Template" is clicked
10. Validation ensures required fields are properly configured before save

### Story 2.7: Template Builder Form - Conditional Task Logic

As an **HR Administrator**,
I want to define conditional rules that show or hide tasks based on custom field values,
so that workflows adapt automatically (e.g., skip office desk assignment if employee is remote).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Each task in template builder has "Add Conditional Rule" button
2. Conditional rule configuration includes: condition field (dropdown of custom fields), operator (dropdown: Equals/Not Equals/Contains), value (text input), action (dropdown: Show Task/Hide Task)
3. Multiple rules can be added to single task (evaluated with AND logic)
4. Rules are displayed under each task with "Remove" button
5. Field dropdown only shows custom fields defined for this template
6. Operator dropdown adapts based on field type (e.g., Boolean only shows Equals/Not Equals)
7. Value input validates based on field type (e.g., date picker for Date fields, dropdown for Select fields)
8. Rules are saved as part of template structure when "Save Template" is clicked
9. Validation ensures rule references valid custom field and operator is compatible with field type
10. Help text or tooltip explains how conditional rules work and provides examples

so that tasks are routed to the correct stakeholders without manual assignment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WorkflowService.assignTasksForWorkflow(workflowInstanceId) method processes all NOT_STARTED tasks that are ready to be assigned
2. "Ready to assign" means: task dependencies are satisfied (prerequisite tasks are COMPLETED) and task is visible (is_visible=true)
3. For each ready task, system identifies users with matching role (assigned_role matches user.role)
4. If multiple users have same role, task is assigned to user with lowest current task load (fewest IN_PROGRESS tasks)
5. Task status transitions from NOT_STARTED to IN_PROGRESS when assigned
6. assigned_user_id is set to selected user
7. due_date is calculated based on configurable SLA (e.g., 2 days from assignment) - use simple default for MVP
8. Method returns list of assigned tasks with user details for notification triggering
9. Method is idempotent (calling multiple times doesn't duplicate assignments)
10. Unit tests cover various scenarios (single assignee, multiple candidates, load balancing)

## Epic 4: Task Completion & Verification

**Epic Goal:** Build the complete task completion experience including email notifications, task completion forms with mandatory checklist verification, and the automated offboarding mirror functionality. This epic delivers the core security value proposition by ensuring every provisioned item is verified during onboarding and automatically included in offboarding checklists, eliminating orphaned accounts and equipment.

### Story 4.1: Task Checklist Data Model

As a **developer**,
I want database schema to store checklist items for each task instance,
so that tech support and other users can verify every provisioned item with mandatory checkboxes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. task_checklist_items table is created with columns: id (UUID), task_instance_id (FK), item_description, category (HARDWARE/SOFTWARE/ACCESS/OTHER), item_identifier (e.g., laptop serial, software license key), is_checked (boolean), checked_at, checked_by (FK users), created_at, updated_at
2. provisioned_items table is created for offboarding mirror: id (UUID), workflow_instance_id (FK), task_instance_id (FK), item_description, category, item_identifier, provisioned_at, provisioned_by (FK users)
3. Foreign key relationships properly defined with cascading deletes where appropriate
4. Indexes created on task_instance_id, workflow_instance_id, category
5. Default value for is_checked is false

so that mandatory verification is enforced at the business logic level.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. TaskService.completeTask(taskInstanceId, checklistItems, userId) method processes task completion
2. Method validates that all checklist items have is_checked=true before allowing completion
3. If validation fails, method returns error: "All checklist items must be verified before completion"
4. On successful validation, method persists checklist items to task_checklist_items table with checked_at and checked_by
5. Method copies all checked items to provisioned_items table for offboarding mirror (if workflow type is ONBOARDING)
6. Method updates task_instance status to COMPLETED and sets completed_at and completed_by
7. Method triggers workflow state update (check if all tasks complete → mark workflow COMPLETED)
8. Method triggers assignment of dependent tasks via WorkflowService.assignTasksForWorkflow()
9. All operations occur in single transaction (checklist save + provisioning log + task update + dependent task assignment)
10. Unit tests cover: successful completion, incomplete checklist rejection, offboarding mirror creation, dependent task triggering

### Story 4.3: Task Completion API

As a **user (assigned task owner)**,
I want API endpoint to complete my assigned tasks with checklist verification,
so that I can mark my work complete once I've verified all items.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. API endpoint POST /api/tasks/{id}/complete accepts: checklist_items array (each with item_description, category, item_identifier, is_checked)
2. Only the assigned user or HR_ADMIN can complete a task (403 Forbidden for others)
3. Task must be in IN_PROGRESS status (400 Bad Request if NOT_STARTED or already COMPLETED)
4. Endpoint calls TaskService.completeTask() for business logic and validation
5. Successful completion returns 200 OK with updated task details and notification that dependent tasks were triggered
6. Failed validation (incomplete checklist) returns 400 Bad Request with specific error message
7. Endpoint supports partial save (POST /api/tasks/{id}/checklist to save progress without completing) allowing users to pause and resume
8. Partial save does not change task status (remains IN_PROGRESS)
9. Swagger documentation with example request showing checklist structure
10. API logs completion event for audit trail

### Story 4.4: Email Notification Service & Templates
