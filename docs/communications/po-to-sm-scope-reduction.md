# Product Owner to Scrum Master: MVP Scope Reduction

**From:** Sarah (Product Owner)
**To:** Bob (Scrum Master)
**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Subject:** MVP Scope Reduction Approved - Sprint Planning Updates Required

---

## Hi Bob,

I've completed the backlog review and prioritization you requested. We need to make an important scope adjustment to ensure the team can deliver a quality MVP within our timeline constraints.

---

## Decision: MVP Scope Reduction

After analyzing our progress on Epic 1 (75% complete - great job team!) and the remaining backlog, I'm formally reducing the MVP scope from 37 stories to 28 stories.

**Bottom Line:**
- **Remaining work:** 20 stories instead of 29 stories (31% reduction)
- **Time savings:** 4-5 weeks (from 12-16 weeks down to 8-11 weeks)
- **Core value preserved:** Offboarding mirror (our key differentiator) stays in scope

---

## What Changed

### ‚úÖ INCLUDED IN MVP
- **Epic 1:** Foundation & Authentication (8 stories) - 6 done, 2 remaining ‚ú®
- **Epic 2:** Workflow Template Management - **SIMPLIFIED** (5 stories, not 7)
  - Removed: Story 2.6 (Custom Fields), Story 2.7 (Conditional Logic)
- **Epic 3:** Workflow Execution & Task Routing (7 stories) - full scope
- **Epic 4:** Task Completion & Verification (8 stories) - full scope

### üîÆ DEFERRED TO PHASE 2
- **Epic 2:** Stories 2.6, 2.7 (Custom Fields, Conditional Logic)
- **Epic 5:** Entire epic (Dashboard & Visibility - all 8 stories)

---

## Why This Makes Sense

**The Good News:**
1. Team is crushing Epic 1 - let's finish strong (Stories 1.7, 1.8 this week!)
2. Reduced scope is realistic for our 2-developer + part-time QA team
3. We keep the **offboarding mirror** (Story 4.7) - our security differentiator
4. MVP still delivers all core workflow functionality
5. Users get a **complete, working product** instead of half-finished features

**The Trade-offs (Worth It):**
1. No custom fields in templates ‚Üí Use 5 fixed fields instead (covers 80% of use cases)
2. No conditional task logic ‚Üí Create multiple template variants (most orgs only need 2-3 anyway)
3. No Kanban dashboard ‚Üí Use basic table views (Epic 3.6, 4.8 provide visibility)
4. No reporting UI ‚Üí Database captures data; full reporting in Phase 2

## What I Need From You (Sprint Planning)

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Update Sprint Planning**
   - Current sprint: Finish Epic 1 (Stories 1.7, 1.8) - **TARGET: This week**
   - Next sprint planning: Focus on Epic 2 simplified (Stories 2.1-2.5 only)
   - Remove Stories 2.6, 2.7, and all Epic 5 stories from MVP backlog in your tracking tools

2. **Team Communication**
   - Facilitate a brief team meeting (15-20 min) to review scope change
   - Emphasize: This is about **quality over quantity** and **setting team up for success**
   - Share the executive summary: `docs/mvp-scope-executive-summary.md`
   - Answer any team questions or concerns

3. **Velocity Adjustment**
   - With reduced scope, we can maintain sustainable pace (1.8-2.5 stories/week)
   - No more pressure to rush - team can focus on quality
   - Epic 1 completion rate (6/8 in ~6-7 weeks) suggests we're on track

4. **Dependency Management**
   - Ensure team knows Epic 2 is simplified (no custom fields means simpler data model)
   - Stories 2.1-2.3 will be easier without custom field/conditional rule complexity
   - Story 3.6 (Workflow List API) and Story 4.8 (Task Queue UI) now serve as MVP "dashboard"

---

## Documentation Available

I've created comprehensive documentation to support this decision:

1. **Detailed Analysis:** `docs/backlog-revision-mvp.md` (27 pages - full breakdown)
2. **Executive Summary:** `docs/mvp-scope-executive-summary.md` (stakeholder communication)
3. **Updated PRD:** `docs/prd.md` (now has scope annotations on all affected stories)
4. **Git Commit:** `4bdd16e` - "Product Owner: MVP Scope Reduction Approved"

All documents are committed and ready for team review.

## Updated Timeline Estimate

Based on current velocity and reduced scope:

| Timeframe | Epic | Stories | Notes |
|-----------|------|---------|-------|
| **Week 1** (Current) | Epic 1 | Stories 1.7, 1.8 | Finish foundation |
| **Weeks 2-4** | Epic 2 (simplified) | Stories 2.1-2.5 | Template management |
| **Weeks 5-8** | Epic 3 | Stories 3.1-3.7 | Workflow execution |
| **Weeks 9-12** | Epic 4 | Stories 4.1-4.8 | Task completion + offboarding mirror ‚≠ê |

**Total:** ~12 weeks for 20 stories (1.67 stories/week - comfortable pace)

**Alternative aggressive timeline:** 8-11 weeks if team maintains 2+ stories/week

---

## Team Messaging Guidance

When you communicate this to the team, here's the framing I recommend:

### Key Messages

**What to Emphasize:**
- ‚úÖ "We're streamlining the MVP to ensure we deliver **quality over quantity**"
- ‚úÖ "Epic 1 is nearly complete - great progress! Let's finish strong."
- ‚úÖ "Reduced scope means we can maintain **sustainable pace** - no burnout"
- ‚úÖ "We're keeping all **critical security features** including the offboarding mirror"
- ‚úÖ "This sets us up for **success**, not just delivery"

**What to Acknowledge:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "We're deferring some nice-to-have features (custom fields, fancy dashboards) to Phase 2"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Users will have workarounds (fixed fields, multiple templates, basic lists) for MVP"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "We'll gather real user feedback before building advanced features in Phase 2"

**What to Avoid:**
- ‚ùå Don't frame as "cutting features due to poor performance"
- ‚ùå Don't imply the team is struggling or behind schedule
- ‚ùå Don't make it sound like a compromise or failure

**Correct Framing:** "Strategic decision to focus on core value and deliver a complete, working product"

---

## Risk Management

**Potential Team Concerns & Responses:**

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| "Are we behind schedule?" | "No - Epic 1 is 75% done and on track. This is a proactive decision to ensure quality delivery." |
| "Will this affect our credibility?" | "Delivering a working product is better than rushing incomplete features. Users will appreciate the quality." |
| "What if users really need custom fields?" | "MVP has 5 fixed fields covering common cases. Phase 2 adds customization based on real usage patterns." |
| "How do we explain 'no dashboard' to stakeholders?" | "We have basic workflow lists and task queues. Full Kanban dashboard comes in Phase 2 after validating core workflows." |
| "Is this a sign of bigger problems?" | "No - this is smart product management. Focus on must-haves first, add nice-to-haves after user validation." |

## Questions for You

Before you communicate to the team, I need your input on:

1. **Sprint Planning Timing**
   - When is the next sprint planning meeting?
   - Should we have a backlog refinement session before then?
   - Do you need me to join to answer PO questions?

2. **Team Capacity**
   - Based on Epic 1 velocity, do you agree with the 1.8-2.5 stories/week estimate?
   - Any concerns about specific stories in Epic 2-4?
   - Should we add buffer time for QA or integration testing?

3. **Stakeholder Communication**
   - Do you need me to join a stakeholder update meeting?
   - Should we communicate this to business sponsors now or after Epic 1 completion?
   - Any specific concerns from the team I should address?

4. **Process Changes**
   - Any changes needed to our definition of done or sprint ceremonies?
   - Should we adjust story point estimation based on reduced complexity?
   - Any retrospective items related to scope management?

## Next Sync

Let's sync to discuss:
- Team reaction to scope change
- Any adjustments needed to sprint planning
- Timeline for Epic 1 completion
- Sprint planning for Epic 2 simplified

**Suggested:** 30-minute call or async update via this thread

## Closing Thoughts

Bob, I'm confident this is the right decision for the team and the product. We've built a solid foundation with Epic 1, and this scope adjustment ensures we can maintain that quality through the rest of the MVP.

The team has done excellent work so far - 6 stories completed in Epic 1 shows we're on track. Let's channel that momentum into delivering a **complete, working product** that solves the core security problem (offboarding mirror) without burning out the team.

**Trust the process. Deliver quality. Gather feedback. Iterate in Phase 2.**

Looking forward to your thoughts and the team's reaction.
