# Story 3.2: Workflow Instantiation Service

## Status
**Done**

## Story

**As a** backend developer,
**I want** service logic that creates workflow instances from templates,
**so that** when HR initiates an onboarding/offboarding, all template tasks are copied to task instances with proper sequencing.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WorkflowService.createWorkflowInstance(templateId, employeeDetails, customFieldValues, initiatedBy) method creates new workflow
2. Method copies all tasks from template to task_instances with references to template_task_id
3. Task sequence_order and dependency relationships are preserved from template
4. Custom field values provided by HR are stored in workflow_instance.custom_field_values as JSON
5. Conditional rules are evaluated immediately on creation; tasks that don't meet conditions are created but marked is_visible=false
6. Workflow status is set to INITIATED initially
7. All task statuses are set to NOT_STARTED initially
8. Audit record is created in workflow_state_history for workflow creation
9. Method returns workflow instance ID and summary (total tasks, immediate tasks to assign)
10. Transaction ensures all-or-nothing creation (workflow + all tasks + history record)
11. Unit tests cover various template scenarios (simple, parallel tasks, conditional tasks)

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

**WorkflowInstance Entity:**
- Primary key: UUID id
- Foreign keys: templateId (WorkflowTemplate), initiatedBy (User)
- Status: Enum (INITIATED, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, COMPLETED)
- Employee fields: employeeName, employeeEmail, employeeRole
- Custom data: customFieldValues (JSONB) - stores Map<String, Object>
- Audit: createdAt, updatedAt (auto-populated by @PrePersist/@PreUpdate)

**TaskInstance Entity:**
- Primary key: UUID id
- Foreign keys: workflowInstanceId (WorkflowInstance), templateTaskId (TemplateTask)
- Assignment: assignedUserId (User, nullable), assignedRole (Enum)
- Status: Enum (NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, COMPLETED)
- Visibility: isVisible (Boolean) - controls conditional task display
- Due date: dueDate (LocalDateTime, nullable)
- Checklist: checklistData (JSONB) - stores partial completion data
- Audit: createdAt, updatedAt

**TemplateTask Entity:**
- Primary key: UUID id
- Foreign key: templateId (WorkflowTemplate)
- Metadata: taskName, description, assignedRole
- Sequencing: sequenceOrder (Integer), isParallel (Boolean)
- Dependencies: dependencyTaskId (self-referential FK to TemplateTask)

**WorkflowStateHistory Entity:**

- WorkflowInstance → WorkflowStateHistory (One-to-Many, cascade delete)
- WorkflowTemplate → TemplateTask (One-to-Many)
- TemplateTask → TemplateTask (self-referential for dependencies)
- TemplateTask → TemplateConditionalRule (One-to-Many)

### Service Layer Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Service Rules:**
1. **Constructor Injection:** All dependencies injected via constructor (immutable, final fields)
2. **@Transactional Annotation:** Place on service methods for transaction management
3. **DTO Usage:** Never expose entities directly, always use DTOs for request/response
4. **Specific Exceptions:** Throw ValidationException, ResourceNotFoundException, ConflictException (not generic RuntimeException)
5. **Return Optional:** For nullable results, use Optional<T>
6. **No @Async in Services:** Async only for email notifications (NotificationService), not workflow logic

**Naming Conventions:**
- Service class: EntityService (e.g., WorkflowService)
- Method pattern: verbEntity (e.g., createWorkflowInstance, assignTasksForWorkflow)
- DTOs: ActionEntityRequest/Response (e.g., EmployeeDetails as request, WorkflowCreationResult as response)

**Transaction Management:**
- Use @Transactional at service layer (not controller)
- Spring will auto-rollback on unchecked exceptions
- Multi-step operations (workflow + tasks + history) must be in single transaction

### Error Handling
[Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

**Custom Exceptions to Use:**
- `ResourceNotFoundException` - Template not found (404)
- `ValidationException` - Template inactive or invalid custom fields (400)
- `ConflictException` - Business rule violations (409)

**Global Exception Handler:** Already implemented (GlobalExceptionHandler.java) - will catch custom exceptions and return standardized ErrorResponse

**Logging Standards:**
- Use SLF4J logger: `private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(WorkflowService.class);`
- Log levels: ERROR (exceptions), WARN (degraded), INFO (workflow created), DEBUG (detailed flow)
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)

### File Locations
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**New Files to Create:**
```
backend/src/
├── main/java/com/magnab/employeelifecycle/
│   ├── service/
│   │   └── WorkflowService.java              # CREATE - Main service class
│   ├── dto/
│   │   ├── request/
│   │   │   └── EmployeeDetails.java          # CREATE - Request DTO

    └── service/
        ├── WorkflowServiceTest.java          # CREATE - Unit tests
        └── WorkflowServiceIntegrationTest.java # CREATE - Integration tests
```

**Existing Files to Reference (DO NOT MODIFY):**
- Entity classes: WorkflowInstance, TaskInstance, WorkflowStateHistory, TemplateTask, WorkflowTemplate
- Repository interfaces: WorkflowInstanceRepository, TaskInstanceRepository, WorkflowStateHistoryRepository, TemplateTaskRepository, WorkflowTemplateRepository
- Exception classes: ResourceNotFoundException, ValidationException (in exception/ package)

### Conditional Logic Evaluation (Future Story)

For AC #5, conditional rule evaluation:
- Full ConditionalRuleEvaluator service will be implemented in a future story (Story 2.6 or similar)
- For MVP Story 3.2, stub the evaluation:
  - If no conditional rules exist for task, set isVisible = true
  - If conditional rules exist, evaluate simple EQUALS comparisons against customFieldValues map
  - For complex operators (CONTAINS, NOT_EQUALS), implement basic logic or defer to future story
- This allows Story 3.2 to be completed without blocking on full conditional logic

### JSONB Handling
[Source: Story 3.1 completion notes]

**Hibernate 6 Native JSONB:**
- Use `@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON)` annotation (already on entity fields)
- Pass Map<String, Object> directly - Hibernate serializes to JSON automatically
- No need for external libraries (hypersistence-utils not needed)

**Custom Field Values Example:**
```java
Map<String, Object> customFieldValues = Map.of(
    "start_date", "2025-11-15",
    "department", "Engineering",
    "remote_status", "hybrid"
);
workflowInstance.setCustomFieldValues(customFieldValues);
```

### Transaction Boundary

**All operations in createWorkflowInstance must be atomic:**
1. Create WorkflowInstance
2. Create all TaskInstance records (batch save)
3. Evaluate conditional rules and update task visibility
4. Create WorkflowStateHistory record

If any step fails, entire transaction rolls back. This is enforced by @Transactional annotation on service method.

## Testing

### Testing Approach for This Story
[Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy.md]

**Unit Tests (JUnit 5 + Mockito):**
- Test file: `backend/src/test/java/com/magnab/employeelifecycle/service/WorkflowServiceTest.java`
- Use @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
- Mock all repository dependencies with @Mock
- Inject WorkflowService with @InjectMocks
- Coverage goal: 80% for service layer

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Happy path: Valid template creates workflow + tasks + history
2. Conditional rules: Tasks marked invisible based on custom field values
3. Parallel tasks: Multiple tasks with same sequence_order handled correctly
4. Error cases: Template not found, template inactive, missing custom fields
5. Transaction rollback: Verify all-or-nothing behavior

**Integration Tests (TestContainers):**
- Test file: `backend/src/test/java/com/magnab/employeelifecycle/service/WorkflowServiceIntegrationTest.java`
- Use @SpringBootTest and @Testcontainers
- Real PostgreSQL 17-alpine container
- Verify database state after workflow creation
- Test transaction rollback with real database

**Example Unit Test Structure:**
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class WorkflowServiceTest {
    @Mock private WorkflowInstanceRepository workflowInstanceRepo;
    @Mock private TaskInstanceRepository taskInstanceRepo;
    @Mock private WorkflowStateHistoryRepository historyRepo;
    @Mock private WorkflowTemplateRepository templateRepo;
    @Mock private TemplateTaskRepository templateTaskRepo;

    @InjectMocks
    private WorkflowService workflowService;

    @Test
    void createWorkflowInstance_WithValidTemplate_CreatesWorkflowAndTasks() {
        // Arrange: Mock template, template tasks
        // Act: Call workflowService.createWorkflowInstance()
        // Assert: Verify repository save calls, result DTO
    }
}
```

**Manual Testing:**
- After Story 3.2 completes, Story 3.5 will create API endpoint
- Use Postman to test POST /api/workflows with real payloads
- Verify database records created correctly

**Coverage Verification:**
- Run: `mvn test jacoco:report`
- Check: `target/site/jacoco/index.html`
- Goal: 80% coverage for WorkflowService class

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] All tasks completed and tested (Tasks 1-11 from story)
- [x] Comprehensive unit tests with Mockito mocking
- [x] Integration tests with TestContainers + real PostgreSQL
- [x] Error handling with specific custom exceptions
- [x] Transaction management with @Transactional
- [x] Logging at appropriate levels (INFO/DEBUG)
- [x] DTO pattern enforced (no entity exposure)
- [x] Constructor injection pattern followed
- [ ] Story 3.3 should implement conditional_rules field and full visibility logic (documented)
- [ ] Consider adding due_date_offset_days field in future story (optional optimization)

### Security Review

**Status: PASS** ✅

- No sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII) logged
- UUID primary keys used for all entities (prevents enumeration attacks)
- Input validation via Jakarta Bean Validation (@NotBlank, @Email)
- Custom exceptions prevent information leakage (no stack traces in business exceptions)
- Transaction boundaries prevent partial data exposure
- No SQL injection risk (all queries via Spring Data JPA repositories)

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS** ✅

- **Efficient batch operations**: taskInstanceRepository.saveAll() used for bulk insert
- **Single query optimization**: findByTemplateIdOrderBySequenceOrder() retrieves all tasks in one query
- **No N+1 queries**: Proper eager/lazy loading configuration on entities
- **Transaction scope minimized**: Only wraps essential database operations
- **Logging optimized**: Debug level used for high-frequency logs

**Potential future optimizations:**
- Consider @BatchSize annotation on task instance collections if workflows have 100+ tasks
- Add pagination for workflows with extremely large task counts (200+)
