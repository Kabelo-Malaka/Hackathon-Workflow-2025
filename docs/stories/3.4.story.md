# Story 3.4: Workflow State Management

## Status
**Done**

## Story

**As a** backend developer,
**I want** service methods that update workflow and task states with proper validation,
**so that** state transitions follow business rules and workflow progresses correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. WorkflowService.updateWorkflowStatus(workflowInstanceId, newStatus, userId, notes) method updates workflow status
2. Valid state transitions are enforced: INITIATED → IN_PROGRESS, IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED/BLOCKED, BLOCKED → IN_PROGRESS
3. Workflow automatically transitions to IN_PROGRESS when first task is assigned
4. Workflow automatically transitions to COMPLETED when all visible tasks are COMPLETED
5. State change is recorded in workflow_state_history with timestamp and user
6. WorkflowService.updateTaskStatus(taskInstanceId, newStatus, userId) method updates task status
7. Valid task state transitions: NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS, IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED/BLOCKED, BLOCKED → IN_PROGRESS
8. When task is marked COMPLETED, completed_at and completed_by are recorded
9. When task is marked COMPLETED, system triggers automatic assignment of dependent tasks
10. Method returns updated workflow state summary (tasks completed, tasks in progress, tasks blocked)
11. Unit tests validate state transition rules and automatic workflow progression

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[Source: Story 3.3 Dev Agent Record]

Story 3.3 successfully implemented task assignment and routing logic:
- WorkflowService.assignTasksForWorkflow() method assigns tasks based on role and load balancing
- Tasks transition from NOT_STARTED to IN_PROGRESS when assigned
- Workflow status is updated to IN_PROGRESS when first task is assigned (AC #5 of Story 3.3)
- All operations in single transaction
- 28 unit tests passing

**Key insight for Story 3.4:** Story 3.3 already handles the automatic transition to IN_PROGRESS (AC #3). Story 3.4 formalizes state management methods and adds validation rules.

**Entities available for Story 3.4:**
- WorkflowInstance, TaskInstance, WorkflowStateHistory (from Story 3.1)
- User (from Story 1.x)

**Repositories available for Story 3.4:**
- WorkflowInstanceRepository, TaskInstanceRepository, WorkflowStateHistoryRepository (from Story 3.1)
- UserRepository (from Story 1.x)

### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Backend Framework:**
- Spring Boot 3.2.2
- Java 17 LTS
- Hibernate 6.4.2 (via Spring Data JPA)
- Maven 3.9.6

**Testing:**
- JUnit 5 (5.10.1) for unit tests
- Mockito 5.8.0 for mocking
- TestContainers 1.19.3 for integration tests
- PostgreSQL 17.2 for test database

**Key Dependencies:**
- Lombok 1.18.30 (entities only, per coding standards)
- SLF4J + Logback for logging

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md]

**WorkflowInstance Entity:**
- Primary key: UUID id
- Status: Enum (INITIATED, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, COMPLETED)
- Timestamps: initiatedAt, completedAt (nullable)
- Foreign key: initiatedBy (User)
- Audit: createdAt, updatedAt

**TaskInstance Entity:**
- Primary key: UUID id
- Foreign keys: workflowInstanceId (WorkflowInstance), templateTaskId (TemplateTask)
- Assignment: assignedUserId (User, nullable), assignedRole (Enum)
- Status: Enum (NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, COMPLETED)
- Visibility: isVisible (Boolean) - controls conditional task display
- Completion: completedAt (LocalDateTime, nullable), completedBy (User, nullable)
- Audit: createdAt, updatedAt

**WorkflowStateHistory Entity:**
- Primary key: UUID id
- Foreign key: workflowInstanceId (WorkflowInstance)
- State tracking: previousStatus, newStatus (WorkflowStatus enums)
- Audit: changedBy (User), changedAt (Timestamp), notes (String)

**Status Enums:**
- WorkflowStatus: INITIATED, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, COMPLETED
- TaskStatus: NOT_STARTED, IN_PROGRESS, BLOCKED, COMPLETED

### Service Layer Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Critical Service Rules:**
1. **Constructor Injection:** All dependencies injected via constructor (immutable, final fields)
2. **@Transactional Annotation:** Place on service methods for transaction management
3. **DTO Usage:** Never expose entities directly, always use DTOs for response
4. **Specific Exceptions:** Throw ValidationException, ResourceNotFoundException (not generic RuntimeException)
5. **Return DTO:** For method returns, use DTOs like WorkflowStateSummary, TaskStatusUpdate
6. **Logger:** Use SLF4J logger: `private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(WorkflowService.class);`

**Naming Conventions:**
- Service class: EntityService (e.g., WorkflowService)
- Method pattern: verbEntity (e.g., updateWorkflowStatus)
- DTOs: ActionEntityResult/Response (e.g., WorkflowStateSummary, TaskStatusUpdate)

**Transaction Management:**
- Use @Transactional at service layer (not controller)
- Spring will auto-rollback on unchecked exceptions
- Multi-step operations (update workflow, create history, check completion) must be in single transaction

### State Transition Validation
[Source: PRD Story 3.4 Requirements]

**Workflow State Transitions (Valid):**
- INITIATED → IN_PROGRESS (first task assigned)
- IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED (all visible tasks done)
- IN_PROGRESS → BLOCKED (issue encountered)
- BLOCKED → IN_PROGRESS (issue resolved)

**Workflow State Transitions (Invalid):**
- Any direct transition to INITIATED (workflows start as INITIATED, never return)
- INITIATED → COMPLETED (must go through IN_PROGRESS)
- INITIATED → BLOCKED (must go through IN_PROGRESS)
- COMPLETED → any other status (terminal state)

**Task State Transitions (Valid):**
- NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS (task assigned)
- IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED (task finished)
- IN_PROGRESS → BLOCKED (blocker encountered)
- BLOCKED → IN_PROGRESS (blocker resolved)

**Task State Transitions (Invalid):**
- NOT_STARTED → COMPLETED (must be IN_PROGRESS first)
- NOT_STARTED → BLOCKED (must be IN_PROGRESS first)
- COMPLETED → any other status (terminal state)

**Validation Implementation:**
```java
private boolean isValidWorkflowTransition(WorkflowStatus current, WorkflowStatus next) {
    if (current == WorkflowStatus.COMPLETED) return false; // Terminal state
    if (next == WorkflowStatus.INITIATED) return false; // Can't return to INITIATED

    return switch (current) {
        case INITIATED -> next == WorkflowStatus.IN_PROGRESS;
        case IN_PROGRESS -> next == WorkflowStatus.COMPLETED || next == WorkflowStatus.BLOCKED;
        case BLOCKED -> next == WorkflowStatus.IN_PROGRESS;
        default -> false;
    };
}

private boolean isValidTaskTransition(TaskStatus current, TaskStatus next) {
    if (current == TaskStatus.COMPLETED) return false; // Terminal state

    return switch (current) {
        case NOT_STARTED -> next == TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS;
        case IN_PROGRESS -> next == TaskStatus.COMPLETED || next == TaskStatus.BLOCKED;
        case BLOCKED -> next == TaskStatus.IN_PROGRESS;
        default -> false;
    };
}
```

### Error Handling
[Source: docs/architecture/error-handling-strategy.md]

**Custom Exceptions to Use:**
- `ResourceNotFoundException` - Workflow or task not found (404)
- `ValidationException` - Invalid state transition (400)

**Error Messages:**
- "Workflow with ID {id} not found"
- "Task with ID {id} not found"
- "Invalid workflow state transition from {current} to {new}"
- "Invalid task state transition from {current} to {new}"

**Logging Standards:**
- Use SLF4J logger: `private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(WorkflowService.class);`
- Log levels:
  - ERROR (exceptions)
  - WARN (unexpected state, invalid transition attempts)
  - INFO (state transitions, workflow completed)
  - DEBUG (state checks, task counts)
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)

**Service Error Handling:**
- If workflow/task not found: throw ResourceNotFoundException
- If transition invalid: throw ValidationException
- If database error: Spring handles with transaction rollback

### File Locations
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**New Files to Create:**

- `repository/TaskInstanceRepository.java` - Add custom query methods

**Existing Files to Reference (DO NOT MODIFY unless required):**
- Entity classes: WorkflowInstance, TaskInstance, WorkflowStateHistory, User
- Repository interfaces: WorkflowInstanceRepository, TaskInstanceRepository, WorkflowStateHistoryRepository, UserRepository
- Enum classes: WorkflowStatus, TaskStatus
- Exception classes: ResourceNotFoundException, ValidationException

### Automatic State Transitions
[Source: PRD Story 3.4 AC #3, #4]

**Workflow → IN_PROGRESS:**
- **Trigger:** First task is assigned in assignTasksForWorkflow()
- **Condition:** Workflow status is INITIATED
- **Action:** Call transitionToInProgressIfNeeded(workflowInstanceId, userId)
- **Implementation:** Check workflow status, if INITIATED call updateWorkflowStatus with IN_PROGRESS

**Workflow → COMPLETED:**
- **Trigger:** Any task is marked COMPLETED in completeTask() (Story 4.2)
- **Condition:** All visible tasks have status = COMPLETED
- **Action:** Call transitionToCompletedIfAllTasksDone(workflowInstanceId, userId)
- **Implementation:** Query tasks, filter isVisible=true, check all COMPLETED, call updateWorkflowStatus

**Task Assignment Trigger:**
- **Trigger:** Task is marked COMPLETED
- **Condition:** Dependent tasks exist (tasks with dependencyTaskId pointing to this task)
- **Action:** Call assignTasksForWorkflow(workflowInstanceId) to assign newly-ready tasks
- **Implementation:** assignTasksForWorkflow already checks dependencies and assigns ready tasks

### Integration with Other Stories
[Source: PRD Epic 3]

**Story 3.3 (Task Assignment):**
- Story 3.3 calls transitionToInProgressIfNeeded() when first task is assigned
- Story 3.4 provides the state management methods that Story 3.3 uses

**Story 4.2 (Task Completion Service):**
- Story 4.2 will call updateTaskStatus() to mark tasks complete
- Story 4.2 will call transitionToCompletedIfAllTasksDone() after task completion
- Story 3.4 provides the state management foundation for task completion

**Note:** Story 3.3 may have already implemented partial state management for AC #3. Story 3.4 formalizes this with proper validation and full state management methods.

## Testing

### Testing Approach for This Story
[Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy.md]

**Unit Tests (JUnit 5 + Mockito):**
- Test file: `backend/src/test/java/com/magnab/employeelifecycle/service/WorkflowServiceStateTest.java`
- Use @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
- Mock all repository dependencies with @Mock
- Inject WorkflowService with @InjectMocks
- Coverage goal: 80% for service layer

**Test Scenarios:**
1. Valid workflow state transitions → Status updated, state history created
2. Invalid workflow state transitions → ValidationException thrown
3. Valid task state transitions → Status updated, completedAt/completedBy set
4. Invalid task state transitions → ValidationException thrown
5. Automatic transition to IN_PROGRESS → Workflow status updates when first task assigned
6. Automatic transition to COMPLETED → Workflow status updates when all visible tasks done
7. Hidden tasks excluded → Only visible tasks count toward completion
8. Dependent task assignment → assignTasksForWorkflow called when task completes
9. State history records → Created with correct fields for all transitions
10. Workflow not found → ResourceNotFoundException thrown
11. Task not found → ResourceNotFoundException thrown

**Integration Tests (TestContainers):**
- Test file: `backend/src/test/java/com/magnab/employeelifecycle/service/WorkflowServiceStateIntegrationTest.java`
- Use @SpringBootTest and @Testcontainers
- Real PostgreSQL 17-alpine container
- Verify database state after transitions
- Test complete workflow lifecycle: INITIATED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED
- Verify state history is persisted correctly
- Test task completion triggers dependent task assignment

**Example Unit Test Structure:**
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class WorkflowServiceStateTest {
    @Mock private WorkflowInstanceRepository workflowRepo;
    @Mock private TaskInstanceRepository taskRepo;
    @Mock private WorkflowStateHistoryRepository historyRepo;
    @Mock private UserRepository userRepo;

    @InjectMocks
    private WorkflowService workflowService;

    @Test
    void updateWorkflowStatus_ValidTransition_UpdatesStatusSuccessfully() {
        // Arrange: Mock workflow with INITIATED status
        // Act: Call updateWorkflowStatus(id, IN_PROGRESS, userId, notes)
        // Assert: Verify status updated, state history created, summary returned
    }

    @Test
    void updateWorkflowStatus_InvalidTransition_ThrowsValidationException() {
        // Arrange: Mock workflow with COMPLETED status
        // Act: Call updateWorkflowStatus(id, IN_PROGRESS, userId, notes)
        // Assert: Verify ValidationException thrown with correct message
    }
}
```

**Coverage Verification:**
- Run: `mvn test jacoco:report`
- Check: `target/site/jacoco/index.html`
- Goal: 80% coverage for WorkflowService class

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment:** EXCELLENT

Story 3.4 demonstrates high-quality implementation with comprehensive testing, clean architecture, and adherence to all coding standards. All 11 acceptance criteria are fully implemented and validated through 25 tests (15 unit + 10 integration). The implementation follows Spring Boot best practices and includes proper transaction management, state validation, and audit trail recording.

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Complete requirements coverage (all 11 ACs implemented and tested)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite with 100% pass rate (169/169 total backend tests)
- ✅ Clean architecture using DTOs, constructor injection, and helper methods
- ✅ Proper transaction boundaries with @Transactional annotations
- ✅ State machine pattern with clear validation rules using modern switch expressions
- ✅ Idempotent automatic transitions (safe to call multiple times)
- ✅ Terminal state enforcement (COMPLETED cannot transition)
- ✅ Complete audit trail via WorkflowStateHistory

### Refactoring Performed

**Performance Optimization - getWorkflowStateSummary Method**

- **File**: `backend/src/main/java/com/magnab/employeelifecycle/service/WorkflowService.java` (lines 565-593)
- **Change**: Replaced in-memory task loading and stream counting with database-level COUNT queries
- **Why**: Original implementation loaded ALL task entities into memory and performed 4 separate stream iterations. This is inefficient for workflows with many tasks and wastes database bandwidth.
- **How**: Utilized existing `countByWorkflowInstanceIdAndStatus()` repository method (line 72 of TaskInstanceRepository) to perform counting at the database level. Changed from:
  ```java
  // BEFORE: Load all tasks, iterate 4 times
  List<TaskInstance> allTasks = repository.findByWorkflowInstanceId(id);
  summary.setTasksCompleted((int) allTasks.stream().filter(...).count());
  // ... 3 more streams
  ```
  To:
  ```java
  // AFTER: 4 efficient COUNT queries at DB level
  Long completed = repository.countByWorkflowInstanceIdAndStatus(id, COMPLETED);
  // ... 3 more counts
  ```
- **Impact**: Reduces memory usage and network transfer. Performance improvement scales with task count (more significant for workflows with 50+ tasks).
- **Verification**: All 169 tests still passing after optimization

**Test Updates Required for Refactoring**

- **File**: `backend/src/test/java/com/magnab/employeelifecycle/service/WorkflowServiceStateTest.java`
- **Change**: Updated 5 unit tests to mock `countByWorkflowInstanceIdAndStatus()` instead of `findByWorkflowInstanceId()`
- **Why**: Tests were mocking the old method signature
- **How**: Replaced mock setup in tests at lines 87, 144, 187, 415, 489

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✅ PASS
  - DTOs at API boundaries (WorkflowStateSummary, TaskStatusUpdate)
  - Constructor injection with final fields
  - @Transactional at service layer
  - Specific exceptions (ResourceNotFoundException, ValidationException)
  - No sensitive data logging
  - Proper naming conventions (updateWorkflowStatus, updateTaskStatus)

- **Project Structure**: ✅ PASS
  - DTOs in dto/response/ package
  - Services in service/ package
  - Repositories in repository/ package
  - Tests in test/ mirroring main structure

- **Testing Strategy**: ✅ PASS
  - Unit tests with Mockito (15 tests in 3 nested classes)
  - Integration tests with TestContainers (10 tests)
  - Test coverage for all ACs
  - Edge cases covered (invalid transitions, terminal states, visible tasks only)

- **All ACs Met**: ✅ PASS
  - All 11 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
  - See requirements traceability matrix in gate file

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Optimized getWorkflowStateSummary for database-level counting (WorkflowService.java:565-593)
- [x] Updated unit tests for refactored method (WorkflowServiceStateTest.java)
- [x] Verified all 169 tests passing after refactoring
- [ ] Consider adding performance metrics/monitoring for state transitions (future enhancement)
- [ ] Consider batch processing optimization if workflows exceed 1000 tasks (future, not current requirement)

### Security Review

**Status:** ✅ PASS - No security concerns

- No sensitive data in logs (verified all log.info statements)
- DTOs prevent accidental entity exposure
- State transition validation prevents invalid operations
- JPA repository methods prevent SQL injection
- @Transactional prevents data corruption from partial updates
- Proper exception handling (no stack traces to clients)

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** ✅ PASS - Optimization applied

- **Optimized:** getWorkflowStateSummary now uses 4 COUNT queries instead of loading full task entities
- **Benefit:** Reduces memory usage and database transfer, especially for workflows with many tasks
- **Database indexes:** Composite indexes on (workflow_instance_id, status) support efficient counting
- **Minor note:** Cascading operations (assignTasksForWorkflow, transitionToCompleted) make multiple DB calls, acceptable for current scale

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified by QA:**
1. `backend/src/main/java/com/magnab/employeelifecycle/service/WorkflowService.java` - Performance optimization of getWorkflowStateSummary method (lines 565-593)
2. `backend/src/test/java/com/magnab/employeelifecycle/service/WorkflowServiceStateTest.java` - Updated test mocks to match refactored implementation

**Note to Dev:** Please update the "File List" section in Dev Agent Record to include these QA modifications.
