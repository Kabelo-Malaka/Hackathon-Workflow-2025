  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No sensitive data logging, proper validation of inputs, UUID primary keys for security, custom exceptions prevent information leakage, transaction boundaries ensure atomicity'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Efficient load balancing query with composite index (assigned_user_id, status), batch save for task updates, composite index on (workflow_instance_id, sequence_order) for ordered retrieval, no N+1 query issues'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: '@Transactional ensures atomic task assignment, idempotent by design (safe to call multiple times), graceful handling of edge cases (no eligible users, missing dependencies), comprehensive error scenarios tested'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent code documentation with comprehensive Javadoc, clear method decomposition with helper methods, self-documenting method names, meaningful variable names, comprehensive test coverage for future refactoring safety'
