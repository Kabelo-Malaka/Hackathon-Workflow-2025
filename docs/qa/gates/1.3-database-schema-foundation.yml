nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'UUID primary keys prevent enumeration attacks; password_hash field ready for BCrypt; complete audit trail (created_at, created_by, updated_at, updated_by); soft delete pattern maintains security history; ENUM type safety prevents role injection; no hardcoded secrets'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Strategic indexes on email and username (most frequent query patterns); efficient UUID generation via PostgreSQL gen_random_uuid(); optimized ENUM storage; fast migration execution (<100ms); appropriate for MVP scale (<10K users)'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Idempotent migrations verified (Liquibase checksums); rollback support tested for both changesets; soft deletes prevent data loss; complete audit trail for debugging; database constraints enforce integrity (UNIQUE, NOT NULL); Liquibase locks prevent partial migrations'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent JavaDoc documentation on entity classes; clear changeset comments; descriptive IDs (001-create-user-role-enum); clean separation of concerns; follows Spring Boot/JPA conventions; README.md database section helps onboarding; full schema version history via Liquibase'

test_architecture_notes: |
  Manual verification approach is appropriate for this database foundation story.
  All 7 verification steps completed successfully with evidence documented.

  Story 1.8 will introduce automated testing framework (JUnit 5, Mockito, TestContainers).
  At that point, recommend prioritizing integration tests for:
  - User entity persistence and retrieval
  - Unique constraint enforcement (username, email)
  - Enum validation (valid and invalid roles)
  - Audit column population (@PrePersist/@PreUpdate)
  - Soft delete behavior (is_active filtering)

  Testing approach properly aligned with architecture decision to defer automated
  testing setup to Story 1.8.

final_assessment: |
  Story 1.3 is exemplary work that establishes a solid database foundation for
  the entire application. The implementation demonstrates deep understanding of
  enterprise data patterns:

  - UUID primary keys for security
  - Complete audit trail for compliance
  - Soft delete pattern for data preservation
  - Strategic indexing for performance
  - Type-safe PostgreSQL ENUMs
  - Proper Liquibase migration management

  Zero issues identified. Code is production-ready. This sets an excellent
  standard for future stories.

  Recommended: Mark story as Done and proceed to Story 1.4 (Authentication &
  Session Management).
