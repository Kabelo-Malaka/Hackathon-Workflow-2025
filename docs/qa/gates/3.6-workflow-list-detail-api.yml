# Quality Gate Decision - Story 3.6
# Generated by Quinn (Test Architect)

schema: 1
story: "3.6"
story_title: "Workflow List & Detail API"
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: "Excellent implementation quality with one critical but easily fixable enum type mismatch bug in repository queries causing 6 integration test failures. Fix requires 10 minutes."
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"

# Waiver status

  active: false

# Critical issue identified
top_issues:
  - id: "BUG-001"
    severity: high
    finding: "Type mismatch in repository JPQL queries - workflowType parameter declared as String but compared against WorkflowType enum field"
    location: "WorkflowInstanceRepository.java lines 57-66, 79-91"
    impact: "Causes HTTP 500 errors on GET /api/workflows endpoint - 6/6 integration tests failing"
    suggested_action: "Parse workflowType to enum in WorkflowService.getWorkflows() before passing to repository (consistent with status parameter handling)"

# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Multi-layer authorization correctly implemented (controller + service). Role-based data visibility enforced. No SQL injection risk with parameterized queries."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Pagination implemented. Read-only transactions used. N+1 query pattern acceptable for current scale (50 items/page). Consider optimization for high-traffic scenarios."
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "Repository bug causes runtime failures. Once fixed, reliability will be excellent."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code with comprehensive documentation. Follows established patterns. Excellent test coverage."

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Fix workflowType enum parsing before deployment"
      - "Verify all 6 integration tests pass after fix"
      - "Run full test suite to confirm 221/221 passing"
    monitor:
      - "Query performance with large datasets (monitor N+1 query pattern)"
      - "Add database indexes if response times exceed SLA"

# Actionable recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: "Parse workflowType to WorkflowType enum in WorkflowService.getWorkflows()"
      refs: ["WorkflowService.java:~710"]
      details: "Add: WorkflowType parsedWorkflowType = (workflowType != null && !workflowType.isBlank()) ? WorkflowType.valueOf(workflowType.toUpperCase()) : null;"
    - action: "Update repository calls to pass parsedWorkflowType instead of String workflowType"
      refs: ["WorkflowService.java:724", "WorkflowService.java:728"]
    - action: "Verify fix resolves all 6 failing integration tests"
      refs: ["WorkflowControllerIntegrationTest.java"]
  future:
    - action: "Consider optimizing task count queries with aggregate SQL (GROUP BY + COUNT)"
      refs: ["WorkflowService.java:mapToWorkflowSummary"]
      details: "Current N+1 query pattern is acceptable but could be optimized for high-traffic scenarios"
    - action: "Add validation test for invalid workflowType parameter (should return 400 Bad Request)"
      refs: ["WorkflowControllerIntegrationTest.java"]
    - action: "Extract enum parameter parsing to helper method (DRY principle)"
