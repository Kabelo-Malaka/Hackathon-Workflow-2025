schema: 1
story: "1.6"
story_title: "Frontend Authentication UI & Routing"
gate: "PASS"
status_reason: "Implementation is complete with all 10 ACs met. Authentication system is secure, maintainable, and production-ready for MVP. Three minor non-blocking issues identified for future improvement. No automated tests per Story 1.8 plan."

top_issues:
  - id: "CONFIG-001"

  - id: "CODE-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "LoginPage sets empty id/email fields in setUser dispatch after login"

  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: low
