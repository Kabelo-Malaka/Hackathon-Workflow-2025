status_reason: "All acceptance criteria implemented and verified. Core authentication is solid with proper security measures. Code quality improved through refactoring. Minor improvements noted for future enhancement."

top_issues:
  - id: "SEC-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "No rate limiting on authentication endpoints (/api/auth/login)"
    suggested_action: "Add rate limiting middleware before production deployment to prevent brute force attacks. Consider: 5 attempts per IP per 15 minutes."
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "AUDIT-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "AuditEvent userId field currently not populated in authentication events"
    suggested_action: "Consider fetching User UUID after successful authentication to populate userId field for better audit trail. This requires additional database query - evaluate performance impact vs. audit value."
    suggested_owner: dev

  - id: "DEP-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "@GenericGenerator annotation deprecated in Hibernate 6.4"
    suggested_action: "Migrate to @UuidGenerator annotation when upgrading Hibernate. Not urgent for MVP."
    suggested_owner: dev

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ BCrypt password hashing with work factor 12
      ✅ Session-based authentication with 15-minute timeout
      ✅ CSRF protection enabled for non-GET requests
      ✅ Generic error messages prevent username enumeration
      ✅ HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags configured
      ✅ No sensitive data in logs
      ✅ Proper JSON escaping in audit metadata (fixed during review)
      ⚠️  Rate limiting not implemented (acceptable for MVP, add before production)

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Async audit logging prevents blocking authentication flow
      ✅ Proper database indexes on users and audit_events tables
      ✅ HikariCP connection pooling configured
      ✅ Session stored in-memory for MVP (acceptable performance)

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Try-catch in audit service prevents cascading failures
      ✅ Proper transaction boundaries (@Transactional on service layer)
      ✅ Inactive users properly rejected with generic message
      ✅ Session invalidation on logout

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: |
      ✅ Clean separation of concerns (Controller -> Service -> Repository)
      ✅ Constructor injection used throughout
      ✅ DTOs at API boundaries (no entity exposure)
      ✅ Proper logging at appropriate levels
      ✅ Error responses follow consistent format (fixed during review)
      ✅ Code is self-documenting with clear naming
