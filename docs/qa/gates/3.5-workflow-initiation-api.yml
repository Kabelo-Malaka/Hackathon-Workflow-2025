nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent security implementation with @PreAuthorize role-based authorization, proper authentication validation via SecurityContextHolder, UnauthorizedException for missing auth, Jakarta Bean Validation for input sanitization, no sensitive data logging, CSRF protection enabled, entity isolation via DTOs. Authorization and authentication fully tested.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Synchronous workflow creation appropriate for use case. No N+1 query problems. Transaction boundaries properly defined at service layer. No memory/resource leaks. Database operations efficient with proper repository usage. Performance testing not required for MVP per strategy.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions (ResourceNotFoundException, ValidationException, UnauthorizedException). Transactional behavior ensures data consistency. All exceptions properly mapped to HTTP status codes. Good logging at appropriate levels. Full test regression passing (184/184 tests).'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent maintainability with clean code, good separation of concerns, DTOs separating API contract from domain model, comprehensive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation, JavaDoc for public methods, clear test structure, and good test naming conventions. No technical debt identified.'
