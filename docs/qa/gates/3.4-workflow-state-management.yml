  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No sensitive data logging, DTOs prevent entity exposure, state validation prevents invalid operations, JPA prevents SQL injection, transactions prevent corruption'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Optimized getWorkflowStateSummary to use DB-level counting (4 COUNT queries) instead of loading all tasks into memory. Composite indexes support efficient queries.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Atomic transactions with rollback, specific exceptions, idempotent operations, terminal state enforcement, complete audit trail'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean architecture with helper methods, comprehensive JavaDoc, modern switch expressions, well-organized tests, DRY principle'
