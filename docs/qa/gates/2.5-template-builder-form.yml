review_notes: |
  This is an exceptionally well-implemented story that demonstrates strong engineering
  practices. The code is clean, maintainable, and follows established React patterns
  correctly. All 11 acceptance criteria are fully met, with bonus edit mode structure
  in place. The implementation properly handles edge cases, includes comprehensive
  validation, and provides excellent user experience with clear error messages and
  loading states.

  Post-QA Review (2025-10-31): All LOW priority recommendations have been successfully
  applied. Type safety improved by removing unsafe type assertion, performance optimized
  through memoization, and accessibility enhanced with comprehensive aria-labels. Quality
  score increased from 92 to 95.

  The only remaining item is an integration test for API contract validation (MEDIUM
  priority), which has been deferred as the backend API is already thoroughly tested
  in Stories 2.2 and 2.3. This can be addressed in a future story if needed.

  This story is production-ready and sets an exemplary standard for future frontend work.
