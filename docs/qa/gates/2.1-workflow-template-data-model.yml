  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Audit columns present, UUID PKs prevent enumeration, FK constraints enforce integrity, no sensitive data. Constraint violation tests verify security boundaries.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Strategic indexes on template_id, sequence_order, workflow_type, template_name. Lazy loading configured. Test execution ~23s including TestContainers startup (improved from 51s).'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'FK constraints prevent orphaned records, cascade deletes ensure consistency, rollback support for all migrations, all tests deterministic. Comprehensive constraint violation testing added.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Well-documented with JavaDoc, clear separation of concerns, Liquibase changesets commented, self-documenting code. Test suite expanded with edge case coverage.'

  future:
    - action: 'Product Owner to decide on AC deviations'
      refs: ['docs/stories/2.1.story.md AC 1-2']
      rationale: 'Current implementation is excellent but deviates from written ACs. PO should formally accept simplifications or request additions.'

    - action: 'If is_active field is required, add it to workflow_templates'
      refs: ['backend/src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml']
      rationale: 'Would enable soft delete functionality if needed for template versioning'
      priority: 'low'
    - action: 'If assigned_role field is required, add it to template_tasks'
      refs: ['backend/src/main/resources/db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml']
      rationale: 'Would enable role-based task assignment in templates'

  strengths:
    - 'Excellent use of @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.NAMED_ENUM) for PostgreSQL enum mapping'
    - 'Proper cascade delete configuration prevents orphaned records'
    - 'Self-referential FK for task dependencies implemented correctly'
    - 'Strategic index placement for query optimization'
    - 'Comprehensive JavaDoc documentation on entities'
    - 'All tests passing with TestContainers PostgreSQL integration'
    - 'Liquibase changesets well-commented with rollback support'
    - 'Audit columns with lifecycle callbacks (@PrePersist/@PreUpdate)'
    - 'Comprehensive constraint violation testing added (9 additional tests)'
    - 'Tests verify UNIQUE, NOT NULL, FK constraints, and DEFAULT value behavior'
  areas_for_improvement:
    - 'AC documentation should match actual implementation (minor field differences)'
    - 'default_status field choice should be formally documented as AC replacement'

final_recommendation: 'CONCERNS - Approve with PO confirmation on AC deviations. Implementation quality is excellent, all 21 tests passing (100%), comprehensive constraint violation testing added, migrations working. Minor AC deviations (missing 3 fields) appear to be intentional MVP simplifications and should be formally accepted by Product Owner before marking story as Done. Test architecture is now comprehensive with EXCELLENT coverage across all dimensions.'
