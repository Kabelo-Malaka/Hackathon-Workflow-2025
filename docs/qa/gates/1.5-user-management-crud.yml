# Quality Gate Decision - Story 1.5: User Management CRUD
schema: 1
story: "1.5"
story_title: "User Management CRUD"
gate: "CONCERNS"
status_reason: "Implementation is functionally complete with all 10 ACs met, but has security concerns: CSRF disabled for /api/users/** endpoints and no password complexity validation. These are acceptable for MVP/Swagger testing but must be addressed before production."
