# Risk Profile: Story 1.8 - Testing Framework Setup

**Date:** 2025-10-31
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)
**Story:** 1.8 - Testing Framework Setup
**Status:** Ready for Review

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified:** 5
- **Critical Risks:** 0
- **High Risks:** 1
- **Medium Risks:** 1
- **Low Risks:** 3
- **Overall Risk Score:** 84/100 (Low Risk)
- **Context:** No CI/CD pipeline required per project decision

## High Risk Items

### 1. [OPS-001]: TestContainers Docker Dependency Creates Development Barrier

**Score: 6 (High)**

**Probability:** High (3) - All developers must have Docker running for integration tests
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Blocks integration tests if Docker unavailable, but unit tests still work

**Description:**
Integration tests using TestContainers require Docker Desktop running on developer machines. This creates an environmental dependency that could block development if Docker is not available or crashes.

**Affected Components:**
- `UserControllerIntegrationTest.java`
- All future integration tests
- CI/CD environments

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Preventive Actions:**
- Document Docker requirement prominently in README.md (✓ Already done)
- Add check in test setup to fail gracefully with clear message if Docker unavailable
- Provide fallback unit test suite that runs without Docker
- Use TestContainers Cloud for CI to avoid Docker-in-Docker issues

**Detective Actions:**
- Monitor test execution metrics for Docker-related failures
- Add health check before test runs: `docker info`

**Corrective Actions:**
- Document troubleshooting guide for common Docker issues
- Provide Docker Desktop installation guide for team
- Consider H2 in-memory fallback for critical unit tests

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test behavior when Docker is not running (should fail with clear message)
- Test TestContainers startup in CI environment
- Measure integration test execution time with TestContainers

**Residual Risk:** Medium - Docker dependency remains, but with good documentation and fallbacks

**Owner:** Dev Team
**Timeline:** Monitor during sprint

## Medium Risk Items

### 2. [OPS-002]: Docker Build Tests Limited to Unit Tests Only

**Score: 4 (Medium)**

**Probability:** Medium (2) - Current Dockerfile configuration skips integration tests
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Integration test failures won't fail Docker builds

**Description:**
The backend Dockerfile includes `RUN mvn test -Dtest='*Test'` which runs only unit tests, explicitly skipping integration tests with TestContainers. This is due to Docker-in-Docker limitations, but means integration test failures won't prevent bad Docker images from being built.

**Affected Components:**
- `backend/Dockerfile`
- Docker Compose builds
- Container image quality

**Mitigation Strategy:**

**Compensating Controls:**
- Run full test suite (including integration tests) in CI before Docker build
- CI should build AND test before creating Docker images
- Add multi-stage Docker build that runs full tests in separate stage (with Docker socket)
- Tag images with test status: `app:v1.0-tested` vs `app:v1.0-untested`

**Current Status:**
- Dev notes indicate this is intentional: "TestContainers require Docker-in-Docker"
- Unit tests DO run in Docker build (prevents many issues)
- Comment in Dockerfile documents limitation

**Recommendations:**
- Keep current Docker configuration (unit tests only)
- Add CI workflow stage: Test → Build → Deploy
- Never deploy Docker images that haven't passed full test suite in CI
- Document this in deployment runbook

**Residual Risk:** Low - Acceptable with CI-enforced full test run

**Owner:** DevOps Team
**Timeline:** Non-blocking, address in CI/CD story

---

## Low Risk Items

### 3. [PERF-001]: TestContainers Startup Latency Increases Build Time

**Score: 3 (Low)**

**Probability:** High (3) - TestContainers always starts PostgreSQL container (~3-5 seconds)
**Impact:** Low (1) - Acceptable overhead for integration test value

**Description:**
Integration tests take ~23 seconds total (per dev notes), with TestContainers adding 3-5 seconds for PostgreSQL container startup. This is within acceptable limits but will increase as test suite grows.

**Mitigation:**
- Use TestContainers singleton pattern (reuse container across tests)
- Optimize PostgreSQL test image (use Alpine variant ✓ Already using postgres:17-alpine)
- Run integration tests in parallel when count increases
- Cache TestContainers images in CI

**Status:** Monitoring - No action needed yet

---

### 4. [BUS-001]: 80% Coverage Threshold May Block Development Velocity

**Score: 2 (Low)**

**Probability:** Low (1) - Currently only Button component, threshold not yet enforced
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Could block PRs if coverage drops below 80%

**Description:**
Jest configured with 80% coverage threshold for statements, branches, functions, and lines. Currently coverage is low (9.3% overall) because only Button component is tested, but threshold would fail in CI.

**Mitigation:**
- Add coverage exceptions for generated code, types, config files (✓ Already configured)
- Review threshold quarterly and adjust based on team velocity
- Allow coverage to be waived by tech lead for specific stories
- Focus on testing critical paths over achieving arbitrary percentage

**Recommendations:**
- Disable coverage threshold in CI initially (fail on no tests, not coverage %)
- Track coverage trend over time, aim for gradual increase
- Set threshold per module, not globally (allow new features lower coverage initially)

**Status:** Acceptable - Threshold documented, can be adjusted

---

### 5. [TECH-001]: Test Configuration Complexity (ES Modules, Jest Setup)

**Score: 1 (Minimal)**

**Probability:** Low (1) - Issues already resolved during implementation
**Impact:** Low (1) - Minor developer confusion when adding new tests

**Description:**
Jest configuration required special handling due to ES modules (jest.config.cjs instead of .js), and several dependencies needed explicit installation (jest-environment-jsdom). Dev notes show 8 technical challenges resolved.

**Mitigation:**
- Document configuration rationale in jest.config.cjs comments (consider adding)
- Add developer onboarding guide for testing
- Include test examples for common scenarios
- Keep dependencies up to date

**Status:** Resolved - No further action needed

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Mitigation Tests

**OPS-001: Docker Dependency**

Test Scenarios:
1. Run tests with Docker stopped → Should fail with clear message
2. Run tests with Docker started → Should pass
3. Document Docker installation steps
4. Test Docker health check before test execution

### Priority 2: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**Standard functional tests:**
- Unit test coverage for new components
- Integration test coverage for new endpoints
- Regression tests for existing functionality

---

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Can Deploy with Mitigation ⚠️

- **OPS-001**: TestContainers Docker dependency
  - **Mitigation**: Documented in README, team has Docker available
  - **Monitoring**: Track Docker-related test failures

- **OPS-002**: Docker builds skip integration tests
  - **Mitigation**: Full tests must run in CI before building images
  - **Monitoring**: Ensure CI configured before using Docker builds

### Accepted Risks ✅

- **PERF-001**: TestContainers startup latency
  - **Justification**: 3-5 second overhead acceptable for integration test value
  - **Monitor**: Re-evaluate if total test time exceeds 5 minutes

- **BUS-001**: 80% coverage threshold
  - **Justification**: Threshold configurable, not enforced initially
  - **Monitor**: Track coverage trend, adjust threshold quarterly

- **TECH-001**: Configuration complexity
  - **Justification**: Already resolved, documented in code
  - **Monitor**: None needed

---

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring:

### TestContainers Performance (PERF-001)
- Container startup time percentile (p50, p95, p99)
- Docker-related test failure rate
- Local test execution time

### Test Health Metrics
- Tests run per day (local execution)
- Test-to-code ratio
- Failed test investigation time
- Test coverage trend over time

### Developer Experience Metrics
- Time to run full test suite locally
- Test failure feedback loop time
- Developer survey on test usefulness

---

## Risk Review Triggers

Update this risk profile when:

1. **Test suite grows beyond 50 tests** → Re-assess PERF-001 (may increase)
2. **Docker-in-Docker configured** → Re-assess OPS-002 (may allow integration tests in Docker)
3. **Coverage threshold enforced** → Re-assess BUS-001 (may increase impact)
4. **New testing frameworks added** → Full risk re-assessment needed
5. **Production incidents traced to missing tests** → Urgency escalation
6. **Docker becomes unavailable for team** → Re-assess OPS-001 (may increase to critical)

---

## Recommendations Summary

### Already Addressed ✅

1. **Document Docker Requirement** (OPS-001)
   - ✅ Already done in README.md
   - Add troubleshooting section
   - Consider pre-test Docker health check
   - Estimate: 1 hour (optional enhancement)

### Nice to Have (Low Priority)

2. **Test Performance Optimization** (PERF-001)
   - Implement TestContainers singleton pattern
   - Run tests in parallel
   - Estimate: 2-3 hours (future sprint)

3. **Coverage Threshold Configuration** (BUS-001)
   - Disable global threshold initially
   - Track coverage trends
   - Set per-module thresholds
   - Estimate: 1 hour (future sprint)
